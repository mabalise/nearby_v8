# Views

Views shown in the content overview are a quick way to see activity for a content item. It's a simple counter that counts all hits. If you refresh the page 10 times within a couple of seconds, that's an increase of 10 views.

Use Google Analytics for reliable statistics, good bot detections and unique visits.
